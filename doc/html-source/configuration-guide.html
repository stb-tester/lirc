    <p>
    This guide tries to describe the basic configuration steps for
    commonly used hardware.  It's focused on the basic usage scenario
    to get the remote up and running, the more advanced features are
    not covered. This includes irexec, lircmd, ir blasting and the
    TCP/IP-based remote features.

    <h2 align="center">Why should I use LIRC?</h2>
    <p>
    Recent Linux kernels have built-in support for IR remotes. Using that,
    pressing an up-arrow on the remote works the same way as pressing the
    up-arrow on a keyboard. This is a modern "just works" solution. On
    the other hand, LIRC is an old style linux application which can be
    tweaked to do almost anything, but is tricky to setup. So, why
    would you use LIRC?
    <ul>
      <li>
        You might have a remote which is supported by LIRC but not the kernel.
        </li>
      <li>
        If you have a remote which isn't supported at all, LIRC is probably
        your best bet to get it running. </li>
      <li>
        You might be on a non-Linux platform supporting lirc e. g., MacOS.
        </li>
      <li>
        You might have an application which is more or less designed to use
        LIRC. </li>
      <li>
        You might need LIRC's capabilities e. g., modes where a single
        remote button can be teached to deliver different keys to the
        application. </a>
      <li>
        You might want to send IR signals to other devices (IR blasting).
        </li>
      <li>
        Handling several applications with one remote is easier with LIRC.
        E. g., you can use irexec(1) to run arbitrary commands in parallel
        with an application such as mythtv or xbmc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    So, while the kernel built-in handling works out of the box in many
    cases, there are still scenarios when LIRC is the right tool.

    <p>
    LIRC can be run together with the kernel in different ways. You need
    to decide on a general approach first.
    </p>
    <p>
    Depending on whether lirc is used or not application will get data
    either from the input layer (/dev/input) or from LIRC (/var/run/lirc).
    Using the LIRC data requires application support. Support for LIRC
    is common in typical linux htpc applications like mythtv, xbmc and vlc.
    </p>
    <p>
    The /var/run/lirc interfaces allows several applications to receive
    input events. On the other hand, the /dev/input interfaces only allows
    one  application to receive the events.
    </p>
    <ul><li>
    A common scenario is to not involve lirc at all, the upmost
    path in the picture (kernel -&gt Linux input layer -&gt application).
    Unless there is reason to use lirc <a href="#why-use-lirc">(above)</a>)
    this is probably the way to go.
    </ul></li>
    <p>
    If you need to use lirc, there is two cases depending on if your
    remote is supported by the kernel or not.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    If it's supported, you should probably at least first try using the
    linux input layer decoding and use that as input to lirc. This is the
    devinput data path in picture (kernel -&gt Linux input layer -&gt lirc
    -&gt app).
    </li>
    <li>
    If the kernel built-in decoding can't be used you need to use a lirc
    driver instead. This is the bottom data path (kernel -&gtlirc -&gt app).
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Last option is to connect the LIRC driver to the linux input layer
    using LIRC's --uinput option. This means that application sees the
    input as coming from the kernel, and LIRC's other capabilities are
    not available. This is not described here.

    The overall lirc blues:
    <ul>
       <li> The remote generates an IR (or perhaps RF) signal.</li>
       <li> The IR data is captured by a capture device such
            as a IR dongle or a built-in ir port.</li>
       <li> Data from the capture device is caught by the linux kernel
            drivers and made available on a kernel device such as
            /dev/lirc0 or /dev/ttyS02.</li>
       <li> Data from the kernel is then caught by LIRC using a
            lirc driver. The lirc driver often needs to know from
            which device it should get the kernel data. This is
            described in
            <A HREF="#determine-driver-and-device">Determine driver and
             device</a>.</li>
       <li> In the next step, lirc converts the IR pulse data from the
            lirc  driver to key symbols either using
            <A HREF="#key-symbols-using-linux-input-layer">the linux input
            layer</a> or <A HREF="#key-symbols-using-lirc-drivers">an lirc
            driver</a> using the lircd.conf file.</li>
       <li> In the next step the application converts the key symbols
            to application-specific strings using the ~/.config/lircrc file.
            This is described in
            <A HREF="#converting-key-symbols-to-application-strings">
             Convert the key symbols to application strings</a> .</li>
    </ul>
    <A NAME="determine-driver-and-device"></A><HR>
    <h3 align="center">Determine driver and device</h3>
    <p>
    To determine the driver to use you might need to know the name of your
    capture device, what module the kernel has loaded for it and the kernel
    device it's connected to.</p>
    <p>
    If our remote is bundled with a capture device such as a usb dongle,
    your first stop is the
    <a href="http://lirc-remotes.sourceforge.net/remotes-table.html">
    remote database</a>. If you can find your device here, look in lircd.conf
    file's header for the following comment:
    <pre>
        this config file was automatically generated
        # using lirc-0.8.5-CVS(awlibusb) on Thu Oct 30 11:03:30 2008
    </pre>
    Here you can learn that this file was recorded using the awlibusb driver.
    Take a note to the final decision.
    <p>
    Next thing to do is to invoke ir-keytable:
    <pre>
    $ ir-keytable
    Found /sys/class/rc/rc0/ (/dev/input/event11) with:
        Driver em28xx, table rc-pinnacle-pctv-hd
        Supported protocols: NEC RC-5 RC-6
        Enabled protocols: RC-5
        Extra capabilities: <access denied>
    </pre> </li>
    If you get this kind of output you know the event device
    (/dev/input/event11) and the kernel module loaded (em28xx).
    Furthermore, since ir-keytable finds the device you know that the
    driver is part of the rc subsystem.  Not all devices are recognized
    by ir-keytable, though.</p>
    <p>
    Next step is to inspect dmesg, possibly after reconnecting your device.
    If you have a standard IR remote which is recognized by the kernel
    you can find how it's registered as rc0:
    <pre>
     usb 3-2: Product: eHome Infrared Transceiver
     Registered IR keymap rc-rc6-mce
     input: Media Center Ed. eHome Infrared Remote Transceiver (0609:031d)
          as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-2/3-2:1.0/rc/rc0/input16
     rc0: Media Center Ed. eHome Infrared Remote Transceiver (0609:031d)
          as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-2/3-2:1.0/rc/rc0
     input: MCE IR Keyboard/Mouse (mceusb) as /devices/virtual/input/input17
     rc rc0: lirc_dev: driver ir-lirc-codec (mceusb) registered at minor = 0
   </pre>
    </p>
    If you just find something like this you have a device which isn't an ir
    device (in this case an RF remote):
    <pre>
        usb 2-2: Product: RF receiver
        usb 2-2: Manufacturer: X10 WTI
    </pre>
    Even if you have an ir device, you might see something like this if the
    kernel sees it as a keyboard rather than a remote. Here, an usb
    keyboard from JITTEL:
    <pre>
    Product: JTTEL Composite Devices
    hid-generic 0003:20E8:5820.0001: input,hidraw0: USB HID v10.01 Keyboard
        [JTTEL Inc. JTTEL Composite Devices] on usb-0000:00:1d.1-1/input0
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    For devices like these which not are registered as rc devices (and thus
    not recognized by ir-keytable) you need to find out the corresponding
    event device as described in <a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a> .</p>
    <p>
    Knowing the capture device name, the kernel module loaded (if any) and
    perhaps also a /dev/input device you have to select a driver:
    <ul>
       <li>
         If ir-keytable located the device you can use the devinput driver.
         This means that the kernel decodes the ir signals and converts them
         to button press symbols. Use something like (with device as from
         ir-keytable):
         <pre>
                --driver devinput --device /dev/input/event11
         </pre></li>
       <li>
         If you dont wan't to use the decoding done by the kernel, but the
         device is recognized by ir-keytable you can have lirc decode the
         raw signal from the driver. This means using the default driver
         which accesses the kernel on a /dev/lirc device, usually
         /dev/lirc0.  Use something like:
         <pre>
               --driver default --device /dev/lirc0
         </pre></li>
       <li>
         If you could find out the driver used to record this device in
         the driver database (above) you should try this driver if it
         makes sense.  If it doesn't make sense i. e., it refers to some
         hardware you don't have just proceed. </li>
       <li>
         if you can find the device name in the
         <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/generic-table.html">generic
         driver list </a> you might try to use this driver.  Refer to
         <a href="#appendix-3"> Appendix 3</a> for details.</li>
       <li>
         If you have a device such as a keyboard which is not recognized
         and can't find a driver in the driver list, your only option is
         using the devinput driver (above).</li>
     </ul>
     If you are to use the devinput driver, read on. Otherwise proceed to

    <p>
    If you're lucky, your remote is already supported by the kernel. In
    order to find out, the first task is to locate the event device,
    something like /dev/input/event12 which is connected to your IR
    device. This is described in <a href="#appendix-2">appendix 2</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    With the device known use ir-keytable to test if your remote works:
    <pre>
    # ir-keytable -t -d /dev/input/event13
    </pre>
    Press buttons on the remote. If it starts to print out scan codes
    and key symbols everything is fine. Otherwise, try to change the
    protocol (see the ir-keytable manpage). If this doesn't work, it
    might be the end of the road and you might need to use the lirc
    driver option instead.  </p>
    <p>
    Check that all buttons generate output when testing. If there are
    buttons which are not mapped (no key symbol) you might not be
    able to fix this unless you go for the lirc driver option (to change
    the key symbol is perfectly possible, but probably not what you want
    here).  </p>
    <p>
    Then, grab the devinput/lircd.conf.devinput file
    <a href="https://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes/code/ci/master/tree/remotes/devinput/devinput.lircd.conf">
    (remotes) </a> and copy it to /etc/lirc/lircd.conf. Start the lircd
    daemon and use irw to check:
    <pre>
    $ lircd --device /dev/input/event13 --driver devinput
    $ irw
    </pre>
    Press remote buttons. You should see the key symbols being printed.
    When so you are done and can proceed to

       The lircd.conf is the file which lircd uses to read data from the
       driver and then convert (or decode) it to key symbols.  It's the
       single most important lirc configuration file. There are some
       ways to find or create such a file.
    <ul>
       <li> The lirc-setup GUI tool can be used to find and download
       both driver and configuration file.</li>
       <li>
       If you manually selected a driver from the driver table it might
       need a specific lircd.conf. Such drivers are best installed using
       the <em>lirc-setup</em> tool but the corresponding configuration files
       can also be downloaded from the website(below)</li>
       <li>
       You can use one of the already existing configuration files the
       lirc website. You can browse
       <a href=http://lirc-remotes.sourceforge.net/remotes-table.html"">
       here</a> or use the
       <a href="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/lirc.org/html/irdb-get.html">
       irdb-get</a> program to search and download such files. </li>
       <li>
       You can create your own configuration using the
       <a href="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/lirc.org/html/irrecord.html">
       irrecord</a> program. </li>
       <li>
       If you already have a config file for the libirman

       that you can find in the contrib directory. </li>

       pronto2lirc</A> script.</li>
     </ul>
    To install the file it should be copied to the lircd.conf.d directory,
    usually /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d. Make sure the name ends with .lircd.conf.
    <p>
    If you are using several remotes you need to combine several lircd.conf
    files. See <a href="#appendix-8"> Appendix8</a> </p>
    <p>
    After installation you should be able to start the the lircd daemon using
    something like:
        <pre>
        $ lircd --nodaemon
        </pre>
    Verify the results using irw(1) in another window. Pressing buttons
    should give something like:
        <pre>
        $ irw
        000000037ff07bef 00 KEY_VOLUMEUP Acer_Aspire_6530G_MCE
        000000037ff07bef 01 KEY_VOLUMEUP Acer_Aspire_6530G_MCE
        000000037ff07bdd 00 KEY_ENTER Acer_Aspire_6530G_MCE
        000000037ff07bdd 02 KEY_ENTER Acer_Aspire_6530G_MCE
        </pre> </p>

    Once irw works you are done with this step: lirc can convert the button
    presses to key symbols. The next step is to convert the symbols to
    application strings.

</pre>
       By now you should know the driver and device used when running
       lircd. Update the configuration file /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf
       with the driver and device you have determined. You should then
       be able to start, stop and inspect the service status using:
<pre>
          # systemctl start lircd.socket
          # systemctl stop lircd.socket
          # systemctl status lircd.socket lircd.service
          # journalctl -b 0  /usr/sbin/lircd
</pre>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
      Check that you can start/stop a working service, irw is your friend.
    </li></ul>
    <p>Using ~/.config/lircrc, convert the key symbols to application-specific
      strings. The first step is to create a simple configuration for just
      one key for the irexec application, dipping a toe into the water.</p>
    <p> First, we need a lircrc file. Create the following file and store
      is as ~/.config/lircrc:
     <pre>
        begin
            remote = mceusb
            button = KEY_RED
            prog   = irexec
            config = echo "foo"
        end
     </pre>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li> The remote (here "mceusb") is the name attribute from the
           lircd.conf file i. e., the line starting with 'name'.</li>
      <li> The button is a key symbol from lircd.conf. If you don't have
           a KEY_RED, use another button.</li>
      <li> The whole idea with this step is that each application has its
           own translation. We will use the simple irexec app as prog for
           now, and check what kind of data it will receive when pressing
           the KEY_RED button.</li>
      <li> The config string is what irexec will receive when we press
           the KEY_RED button.
    </ul>
    With this irexec file in place, we use ircat(1) to check what irexec
    receives when we push the KEY_RED button:
    <pre>
        $ ./ircat irexec
        echo "foo"
        echo "foo"
        echo "foo"
        ^C
        $
    </pre>
    So, at this point you can start irexec, and it will do actually
    echo some "foo" when you press the red button:
    <pre>
        $ ./irexec
        foo
        foo
        ^C
        $
    </pre>
    With this simple example working, you now need to create complete
    config files for your application(s). First, you should read
    <a href="configure.html#lircrc_format">.lircrc chapter </a>. Then,
    create your application config setup in ~/.config/lircrc and test
    it with ircat as above</p>
    <p>
    Depending on your application, lirc-config-tool might be able to
    generate a starting point. See <a href="appendix-5">(below)</a>. </p>
    <p>
    Once the application is up, you might want to exploit LIRC's
    capabilities:
    <ul>
         <li>Using <a href="irexec.html">irexec(1)</a> you can configure
           lirc to run arbitrary program when a button is pressed.</li>
         <li> Using <a href="lircmd.html">lircmd(1)</a> you can use lirc
           to let the remote emulate a mouse. </li>
         <li>You can setup lirc to transmit IR signals (IR blasting) to
           other devices e. g., let the remote send ir signals to a TV
           set. The program is <a href="irsend.html">irsend(1)</a>, you
           might want to scan the web for howto:s.</li>

    <A NAME="appendix-1"></A>
    <h3 align="center"> A1: Configuring the kernel</h3>
     <p>
     When using an LIRC ir driver, the kernel ir driver must be
     configured to send the data only to the /dev/lirc device and not
     to the general input layer. If not, each button event will delivered
     twice to the application, both through /var/run/lirc and /dev/input.</p>
     <p>
     <i> As of 0.9.1+ this is configured automatically by lircd, and
     neither the echo 'lirc' >/sys/class/rc/... nor the udev rule should
     normally be required. </i> </p>
     <p>
     Also, some lirc drivers conflicts with the kernel drivers. A common
     example is the lirc atilibusb driver which conflicts with the kernel
     ati_remote driver. Another example is lirc serial drivers which
     conflicts with the kernel default tty driver. Such conflicts shows
     up as dmesg output about not being able to open the involved device,
     plus various other symptoms.  </p>
     <p>
     If required, the kernel driver configuration can be done using the
     interfaces under /sys/class/rc or using a udev rule. Conflicting kernel
     drivers must be blacklisted. Conflicts on serial ports can be handled by
     disabling the kernel serial driver for that port.</p>
    <A NAME="kernel-driver-configuration"></A>
    <h4 align="center"> Kernel driver configuration.</h4>
    <p>
    The builtin ir driver subsystem is aware of LIRC, and is capable to send
    all data through /dev/lirc0. If lircd fails to configure this
    automatically it can be done manually:
    <pre>
        # echo -- 'lirc' > /sys/class/rc/rc0/protocols
    </pre>
    Here, 'rc0' is OK if you have only one infrared device. Note that
    this is not persistent, you need to do this after each boot.  </p>
    <p>
    Using '-lirc' instead restores the normal kernel operation when
    stopping LIRC. </>
    <A NAME="udev-rules"></A>
    <h4 align="center">Udev rules</h4>
    <p>Likewise, if lircd fails to configure the kernel automatically
    you can create a file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-remote-control-lirc like:
    <pre>
       SUBSYSTEM=="rc", ATTR{protocols}="lirc"
    </pre>
    This is persistent and makes all ir devices send data only
    through /dev/lirc where it can be retrieved by the 'default' driver.</p>
    <A NAME="blacklisting-modules"></A>
    <h4 align="center">Blacklisting modules.</h4>
    <p>
    When using remotes which are not infrared, the corresponding driver is
    not affected by the methods above. One example is an RF remote I have
    which uses the atilibusb LIRC driver. This conflicts with the ati_remote
    kernel module, which thus needs to be disabled. Do this by creating the
    file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-atiremote.conf like:
    <pre>
        # Conflicts with LIRC.
        blacklist ati_remote
    </pre>
    Finding out what module to blacklist is not always easy. dmesg(1)
    sometimes gives a hint about conflicts on a device. Another method is
    to boot the system without the usb device connected, and do a lsmod.
    After that, connect the device and make a new lsmod. Comparing the
    different outputs might give a clue.
    </p>
    <A NAME="serial_port_reservation"></A>
    <h4 align="center">Disabling kernel serial port reservation</h4>
    <p>
      Usually the default kernel serial port driver grabs all ports it
      auto-detects as soon as it is loaded and the LIRC modules won't
      be able to use any of them.  </p>
    <P>
      There are two solutions for this problem. Either you load the
      LIRC module before the kernel serial port driver is loaded
      or you call <em>setserial /dev/ttySx uart none</em> to release
      the according port. setserial usually is already called during
      boot-up in some init script whose location depends on the
      distribution you use. You should check your setserial
      configuration to only configure available ports. Debian users
      should adjust their <em>/etc/serial.conf</em>.
    </P>

    <A NAME="appendix-2"></A>
    <h3 align="center"> A2: Finding the event device</h3>
    <p>
    For many tasks it's necessary to find out the event device, something
    like /dev/input/event12, which is connected to your IR input.</p>
    <p>
    The first try is to invoke ir-keytable without any options:
    <pre>
        $ ir-keytable
        Found /sys/class/rc/rc0/ (/dev/input/event11) with:
            Driver em28xx, table rc-pinnacle-pctv-hd
            Supported protocols: NEC RC-5 RC-6
            Enabled protocols: RC-5
            Extra capabilities: <access denied>
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    If the reported device matches your expectations you're done - here we
    have /dev/input/event11.</p>
    <p>
    If this doesn't work next try is to look in in /dev/input/by-id. If you
    find a device here which looks like your device, check where it's linked:
    <pre>
    $ ls /dev/input/by-id
    usb-Plus_More_Enterprise_LTD._USB-compliant_keyboard-event-kbd
    usb-_Home_Infrared_Transceiver_TS0013Yn-event-if00

    $ ls -l /dev/input/by-id/usb-eHome_Infrared_Transceiver_TS0013Yn-event-if00
    lrwxrwxrwx [cut] /dev/input/by-id/usb-eHome_Infrared_Transceiver_TS0013Yn-event-if00 -> ../event13
    </pre>
    So, here your interface is /dev/input/event13, and your're done.</p>
    <p>
    If this does not work, cat the input devices under /sys.
    <pre>
        $ cat /proc/bus/input/devices > foo
    </pre>
    Look in foo to find this snippet about your device:
    <pre>
        I: Bus=0003 Vendor=2013 Product=024f Version=0001
        N: Name="em28xx IR (em28174 #0)"
        P: Phys=usb-0000:00:1d.7-1/input0
        S: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-1/rc/rc0/input14
    </pre>
    Here, the device is /dev/input/event14. </p>

    <A NAME="appendix-3"></A>
    <h3 align="center"> A3: Understanding the driver table</h3>
    <p>
    The <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/table.html">driver list </a>
    gives some hints on the usage for each driver. The important columns
    are "Hardware", "Required LIRC kernel module", "lircd driver" and
    "Default lircd and lircmd config files".</p>
    <p>
    The "Hardware" column should be obvious. Note that it in many cases
    it refers to the receiver unit (e. g., the name reported by dmesg), not
    the name of the remote. So, before looking for a suitable driver
    use dmesg to find out the name as described in <a href="apppendix-2">
    Appendix 2</a></p>
    <p>
    The "lircd driver" refers to the argument you should give to lircd
    i. e., --driver=... You might need to check that the driver is
    available using <em>irrecord -H help</em>. If it's not listed here
    you need to rebuild lirc which is outside the scope of this document.
    </p>
    <p>
    The "Required LIRC kernel modules" refers to modules that are part of
    the linux kernel. Some of these are regular modules and should be
    available in any reasonably updated linux system. However, some of
    these modules are part of the staging drivers and might not be
    available on your system.</p>
    <p>
    To look for a particular module just search for it in /lib/modules
    e. g.,
    <pre>
        $ find  /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -name lirc_imon\*
        /lib/modules/3.12.7-300.fc20.i686/kernel/drivers/staging/media/lirc/lirc_imon.ko
    </pre>
    If it's listed, kernel should load it automatically on-demand. If it's
    not you have to build the staging drivers, also outside the scope of
    this document.  </p>
    <p> The Supported Remotes column reflects what kind of lircd.conf files
    which are supported. Common values are 'Any' meaning that any file
    from the website could be used or 'bundled' meaning that the driver
    requires a specific config file. In some cases any file can be used
    if it conforms to some limitation. </p>
    <p>
    Unfortunately, the driver list does not provide information on the
    device which should be used for a particular driver. The only way
    to be sure is actually inspecting he sources. You might try to search
    the web before walking this path, though.</p>

    <A NAME="appendix-4"></A>
    <h3 align="center"> A4: Normalizing the lircd.conf</h3>
    <p>
    Several of the pre-defined remotes uses non-standard key symbols. This
    is a Bad Thing, which makes it harder to create the ~/.config/lircrc file
    in next step. It's also a problem when using the uinput option, or when
    converting to use the build-in decoding.</p>
    <p>
    You should replace all non-standard definitions with standard key symbols
    where it's possible. Some buttons might not be
    possible to map to standard symbols is a sane way, and could be left
    as-is. But the vast majority of buttons should use standard symbols.
    The standard symbols a. k. a. the namespace, is listed by irrecord -l.
    </p>
    <p>
    The script lirc-config-tool is helpful here. List all non-standard
    symbols in lircd.conf:
    <pre>
        $ lirc-config-tool -s -c /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
    </pre>
    Update the lircd.conf file with standard key symbols as applicable:
    <pre>
        $ sudo lirc-config-tool -u -c /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
    </pre>
    </p>

    <A NAME="appendix-5"></A>
    <h3 align="center"> A5: Generating the .lircrc</h3>
    <p>
    The .lircrc file basically combines the remote buttons with application
    capabilities. To actually write a .lircrc file from scratch is not that
    hard, but it's a lot of work. lirc-config-tool can save some of this
    work by creating a starting point. For this to work , the lircd.conf
    file must be in place. It must also use standard key symbols from the
    namespaceii as described above.</p>
    <p>
    The first step is to check if your application is supported by the script:
    <pre>
        $ ./lirc-config-tool -l
    </pre>
    if you find your application here, you can make an .lircrc for that app:
    <pre>
        $ ./lirc-config-tool -o . vlc
    </pre>
    If you're using the devinput lircd.conf, create a new version of that
    file which only contains the key symbols you are actually using. Use
    this instead in the -c option to let lirc-config-tool make it's work.
    </p>The generated file will look like (excerpt!)</p>

    The comments are about buttons which havn't found a use, and capabilities
    in the program (vlc) which are not bound to a button. Obviously, this
    saves some work.</p>

    The lirc-config-tool has a -h and a manpage option for more info.</p>

    <A NAME="appendix-6"></A>
    <h3 align="center">A6 : Addressing changing event devices</h3>
    <p>
    When using the devinput driver, input devices like /dev/input/event12
    might come up as another device after a reboot. If this becomes a problem,
    you should address the device using it's name or it's physical bus address.
    </p> <p>
    The first step is to inspect dmesg after connecting the device. There you
    should find something like:
    <pre>
    rc0: Media Center Ed. eHome Infrared Remote Transceiver (1784:0001) as
        /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb4/4-4/4-4:1.0/rc/rc0
    </pre>
    Here you can see the device's name: "Media center Ed. eHome..." and it's
    address: ...usb4/4-4/4-4:1.0/rc/rc0.</p>
    <p>
    As long as you have only one remote of each kind you can use simple
    name matching like in
    <pre>
       --device=name='*eHome*'
    </pre>
    If you have several devices with the same name you need to use the address
    instead. Since this depends on how the device is connected, you lose if you
    disconnect the device and reconnect it to another socket. With this
    limitation you can use phys=*usb4/4-4/4-4:1.0* in the same way as name.

    <A NAME="appendix-7"></A>
    <h3 align="center">A7 : Running irexec</h3>
    <p>
    After having configured lirc, you might want to run irexec(1). Using
    this, you can bind remote buttons to any command you can run. It's
    typically used to shut down system, system volume controls etc.</p>
    <p>
    There is two ways to run irexec, both with their pros and cons.</p>
    <p>
    The first way is to run irexec as a system daemon. This can be done in
    many ways e. g., from a rc.local script or as a systemd service. Any way
    you will have security problems since running arbitrary commands and
    scripts as root is generally a bad idea. There is also the problem that
    irexec runs outside your session which means it's problematic to access
    the display, sound system and other resources typically bound to the
    session. On the other hand, this is flexible and since irexec runs as
    root it can in the end do anything </p>
    <p>
    The second way to run irexec is to run is as a part of the session. A
    standard way to do this is to drop a irexec.desktop file in the config
    autostart  directory, normally ~/.config/autostart.  Doing so you can
    use your desktop tools to control the service. Also, since the service
    runs as part of your session, it can access the display, sound system
    etc.</p>
    <p>
    The drawback is that since it runs as a regular user, it might run into
    permission problems e. g., when trying to shut down the computer. This
    can be handled using sudo, giving the user running irexec right to
    run specific commands otherwise requiring root permission. E. g., the
    following entry in /etc/sudoers  allows the htpc user to restart gdm,
    effectively making a soft reboot:
    <pre>
        ## Allows members of the htpc group to restart session service
        %htpc ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart gdm.service
    </pre>
    All in all, to configure irexec:
    <ul>
        <li> Copy irexec.desktop from the contrib directory to
             ~/.config/autostart</li>
        <li> Possibly add entries to /etc/sudoers (above) if you need to
             run otherwise restricted commands.</li>
        <li> Enable the session service using e. g. gnome settings or
             corresponding tools.</li>

    <h3 align="center">A8 : Using multiple remotes</h3>
    lirc will happily accept several lircd.conf file. When doing so, it
    will try to match input with each configuration until there is a match.
    This means that the number of configurations has some limits, otherwise
    it would take too long time. For practical scenarios say 2-4 remotes
    this shouldn't really be a problem on modern hardware.

    There are a number of ways to combine several configurations:
    <ul>
    <li> The old method has been to just paste several configuration files into
         lircd.conf. This method is deprecated, since you will loose track of
         which files that actually are in use. </li>

    <li> Another way is to use the <code>include</code> directive. Using this,
         you can include files without changing them e. g., using a file like
<pre>
                include "/usr/share/lirc-remotes/ei/tv90"
                include "MKJ61842704"
</pre>
         A relative path like MKJ61842704 is supposed to live in the same
         dir as the main lircd.conf file, usually <code>/etc/lirc</code>.
         All-in-all, this is good method which preserves the original files
         </li>
    <li> Another way is to install the files in the directory lircd.conf.d.
         This directory should b in the same place as the main
         lircd.conf file, usually /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/. Any file in this
         directory which has a name ending with <code>.conf</code> is
         automagically included. One way to use this is to symlink remotes
         from e. g., /usr/share/lirc-remotes to this directory. </li>
    </ul>
    When using multiple remotes lircd tries to sort them so that the ones
    which decodes faster are used first. Normally you could use this feature
    as-is.  However, if you want to define the order yourself you should set
    the attribute <code>manual_sort</code> to 1 in any of the configs. Doing
    so disables the automatic sorting.
    <p>
    In manual sort mode the remotes are used in the order they appear in the
    config file. Files in lircd.conf.d are used in order defined by the
    filenames. The recommended way to use this is to name the links to
    <code>00-my_first_remote.conf</code>,<code> 01-next-remote.conf</code>
    etc. </p>
    <p>
    To add the manual_sort attribute to an existing remote is actually a bad
    idea since it creates cross-depencies between configurations. A cleaner
    way is to add a dummy remote like this in lircd.conf.d (the name does not
    matter):
<pre>
        begin remote
            name manual_sort
            manual_sort 1
            begin codes
            end codes
        end remote
</pre>
