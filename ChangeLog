    daemons-lircd: Set the protocol for rc device used.
    
    There are tons of descriptions how to echo lirc >
    /sys/class/rc/rcX/protocols to make lirc work as intended. This is
    needlessly complicated. This patch tries to locate the device used
    presuming that if the device /dev/lircN actually refers to
    /sys/class/rc/rcX there is a link /sys/class/rc/rcX/lircN. This is
    not part of the stable kernel interface as I understand, but should
    be good enough for now. If found, 'lirc' is just written to the
    corresponding 'protocols' file.
    
    If the driver is devinput, no protocol change is done. If the device
    isn't an rc device the logic will try to set protocol but silently
    fails since it will not find  a device link in the rc directories.
    
    Existing wrapper scripts should not be a problem, doing this twice
    does not make any difference.
    
    The systemd installation is of course so much simpler not having
    to cope with this stuff.

    doc: Revamp build system to comply with autotool defaults.
    
    The doc was strange with the build done in special targets,
    not invoked on ordinary "make all". As a  consequence, simple
    "make distcheck" fails in a number of more or less interesting
    ways.
    
    New Makefile declares the docs as standard DATA variables handled
    by automake and built by 'make all'.  This one actually passes
    "make distcheck". The downside is that Makefile.am is full of
    long lists.
    
    New version does not distribute the manpages. In general, this is a
    bad idea since the final layout might depend on configure. In this
    case, some pages are not even installed depending on configuration.
    
    Adds a new build dependency on help2man dince the docs re always built.
    
    Update Makefile.am to comply with distcheck requirements.

    doc: Re-format lircd.8, irexec.1 using standard macros.
    
    The default way creating manpages using help2man works fine for
    most pages. However, for the larger ones the synopsis becomes
    too long and the text needs some formatting to be readable.
    Fixed using a proxy for the help message and old-fashioned
    manpage markup formatting.

    Fix whitespace issues, new fix-whitespace script and pre-commit hook.
    
    For sources use tabs instead of spaces, strip trailing whitespace
    (i. e., kernel formatting conventions ).
    
    All other files (besides Makefile*) uses space for indentation and
    also strips trailing whitespace. Fix occasional occurrences of
    explicit tabs in shell script search patterns etc.
    
    Add a pre-commit hook which fixes this if installed as
    .git/hooks/pre-commit (use git commit --no-verify to disable).
    
    The fix-whitespace filter can be used as a tree-filter to
    enforce rules on garbled trees.

    Try also debian defaults, and use simple grepping in the

    < 2.5; there shouldn't be many of those out there.

    hw_uirt2_raw: Hold DTR until all data recieved.
    
    This bug applies to Debian 13.04, but I can't imagine it not impacting
    any Linux LIRC install using the UIRT2 via the /dev/ttyUSB0.  The
    UIRT2 code raises DTR (which powers down the emitter) before all
    the bits are transmitted, keeping the receiving device from reliably
    receiving the bit stream.
    
    Supplied patch is WRT git trunk.  This patch is extracted from a larger
    patch submitted by John Wehle in 2010.  Danger of causing other
    regressions is small, as all it does is insert a small delay before
    letting the UIRT2 de-init (which fiddles the DTR signal) happen.

    systemd support: Hook up installation in autotools setup.
    
    Installs lirc as two separate systemd services lircd.socket
    and lircmd.service. Systemd's requires/wants declarations
    doesn't really fit the bill for an overall lirc service.
    
    Part of this is a Fedora setup: the systemd environment is in
    /etc/sysconfig/lirc, and this file is referenced in lircd.service.
    This could be generalized with e. g., an user option to configure,
    but as of now this is left to downstream to patch.

    Add systemd socket activation support.
    
    Since systemd was introduced lirc clients have had problems at
    startup when trying to connect to the lircd socket before it's
    created. The root cause is the aggressive parallell boot performed
    by systemd.
    
    The solution is to add socket activation. In this mode, the socket
    is created by systemd and handed over to lircd at startup. The patch
    implements this. It should be reasonably transparent.
    
    At configure time it enables systemd support if it's available,
    otherwise it's silently ignored.
    
    In runtime lircd looks for and uses a socket handed over by systemd.
    If there is no such socket it proceeds as normal.
    
    Adds a dependency on pkg-config for the PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro.

    [media] lirc_dev: fixes in lirc_dev_fop_read()
    
    Backport from upstream kernel:
    
    commit 250f7a5f62a08985af5cf7728ae7ba9edbfdc0a9
    Author: Dan Carpenter <error27@gmail.com>

        [media] lirc_dev: fixes in lirc_dev_fop_read()
    
        This makes several changes but they're in one function and sort of
        related:
    
        "buf" was leaked on error.  The leak if we try to read an invalid
        length is the main concern because it could be triggered over and
        over.
    
        If the copy_to_user() failed, then the original code returned the
        number of bytes remaining.  read() is supposed to be the opposite way,
        where we return the number of bytes copied.  I changed it to just return
        -EFAULT on errors.
    
        Also I changed the debug output from "-EFAULT" to just "<fail>" because
        it isn't -EFAULT necessarily.  And since we go though that path if the
        length is invalid now, there was another debug print that I removed.

        There does not seem to be a need for lirc to
        allow seeking on the file descriptor, so let's
        just disallow this before users start relying
        on it.

    userspace: use /dev/lirc0 as default device
    
    The lirc_dev kernel driver results in a first lirc chardev of
    /dev/lirc0, not /dev/lirc, so lets default to that now. The old way is
    from pre-udev days or something, I think... While we're at it, update
    the adjacent comment about the daemon socket locations to reflect
    current reality too.

    I came across posts with regards to lirc_atiusb and its compatibility
    with newer kernels, and their use of kfifo.I spent a little bit of time
    this evening, and was able to correct the issues with the driver, and
    now have a functioning lirc_atiusb device under the 2.6.38 kernel.

    reformat all userspace code to look more like kernel code
    
    I have a hard time reading code that isn't consistently formatted,
    and/or uses a format other than the Linux kernel CodingStandards format.
    So hey, lets make this all look more like kernel code. Entire diff
    generated by running the following over the daemons and tools subdirs:
    
    indent -npro -kr -i8 -ts8 -sob -l120 -ss -ncs -cp1 -il0
    
    Only differs from the kernel in that I went with 120 columns instead of
    80, as the 80 char limit often makes for nasty line-wraps.

    lircd: fix things up so decode behaves correctly
    
    There were a few things I changed to __u32 earlier that should have been
    left as unsigned long, and the old #ifdef __GLIBC__ hack appears to be
    no longer necessary with ir_code as a __u64 (could be glibc got fixed,
    not sure, but it works, so lets drop the cruft). Also converts a few
    things that are type lirc_t that store return values from functions that
    returned unsigned longs (now __u32's, mostly) over to __u32 types.
    
    With this, lirc encode and decode behave 100% identical with 0.8.7
    again, at least in testing on a 64-bit system...

    Doesn't matter. I understand now what happens and why I wasn't able to
    reproduce it with the current simulation tools.
    I hacked together a better simulator and can see the same behaviour that
    you described.
    
    Attached is a patch that should fix the problem.

    support usb-uirt on FreeBSD
    
    The enclosed lightly tested patch allows lirc to build on FreeBSD 8.1
    and talk to an usb-uirt.  Note that the FreeBSD uftdi driver module
    needs to be patch in order to recognize the usb-uirt.  The necessary
    changes are logged with the FreeBSD bugs database as usb/149900.
    
    Changes:
    
     1) Include <netinet/in.h> when compiling irsend.c.
    
     2) Include <sys/ioctl.h> when compiling lircd.c.  For simplicity you
        may want to included it on all platforms rather than using the
        current conditional include.
    
     3) Mark uinputfd stuff in lircmd.c as specific to linux.  I used the
        same approach as had already been done for the uinputfd stuff in
        lircd.c.
    
     4) Normalize tv in hw_uirt2_common.c mywaitfordata to avoid an
        EINVAL when calling select.  I used the same approach as had
        already been done elsewhere in the code.
    
     5) Also set the character size and hardware handshaking when setting
        up the serial port for the usb-uirt.

    daemon: quiet spurious serial invalid lock complaints
    
    The enclosed lightly tested patch quiets some spurious serial invalid
    lock complaints which occur on FreeBSD 8.1.
    
    Changes:
    
     1) Skip "." and ".." when looking for locks.
    
     2) Requiring the pid in the lock file to be newline terminated is
        overly strict ... treat it as valid if it's the only thing in
        the file or if it's newline terminated.

    lirc_mceusb: override bInterval on topseed 0x0008 to 1
    
    Complete and total testing involves actually yanking the device out
    of the system, not just unloading and reloading the driver... The
    topseed 0x0008 device comes up like so:
    
    usb 2-9: config 1 interface 0 altsetting 0 endpoint 0x1 has an invalid bInterval 0, changing to 32
    usb 2-9: config 1 interface 0 altsetting 0 endpoint 0x82 has an invalid bInterval 0, changing to 32
    
    If we load the old lirc_mceusb, that got set to 1. Unload and load up an
    updated lirc_mceusb to enable transmit, and it sticks at 1. Unplug and
    replug with the updated driver and its back at 32, and the thing gets
    completely wedged.
    
    Upon inspection, the topseed 0x0001 and original ms mce transceiver also
    come up with a stock bInterval of 0, so we're back to setting it to 1 for
    everything but the pinnacle transceiver, where whatever its default is
    seems to be required for functionality. Meh.

    lirc_mceusb: enable transmit on topseed 0x0008 devices
    
    Special thanks to Greg Oliver for providing the hardware to
    debug and figure out the proper intialization sequence for
    this device.
    
    Essentially, there seems to be a 3rd-gen class of mceusb devices,
    which require different initialization from the 2nd-gen (and 1st-gen),
    so I've created a new device table for those.
    
    There's a quirk with a note about a usb reset being required for the
    pinnacle device... That reset actually wedges the topseed 0x0008,
    and the required magic for it is actually to send the mce device
    reset command to the device prior to starting the init sequence. I
    *suspect* this would also work in place of the crap being done for
    the pinnacle device right now, but I don't have one to test that theory
    out, so I'm leaving it be for now...
    
    Nb: in the future, the multitude of tables here and in the imon driver
    should be converted to device quirk tables, a la the upstream firewire
    driver... (first example that comes to mind).

    lirc_mceusb: explain the init process better
    
    I've been sitting on a post from a Kevin Timmerman to
    gmane.comp.hardware.lirc from back in early 2007 that details
    a bunch of the mce device command strings and their meanings.
    Transcribe that into comments in the code and give the various
    strings more descriptive names. For example, 'pin_init1' is
    actually 'get carrier mode and frequency'.
    
    More detailed debugging spew that also utilizes this data soon
    to follow...

    lirc_mceusb: refactor packet request handler
    
    First up, support for async inbound data was pointless, it only got
    used by the init sequences, which are actually better served by sync
    requests, so simplify that.
    
    Second, request_packet_async was never really a proper name, since its
    both generic and wrong (supports sync reqs too), so rename it to
    mce_request_packet.
    
    Third, add wrappers for inbound and outbound requests to reduce a ton
    of duplication and make the code easier to read.

    handle MCE/RC-6 IR protocol mode, and I mistakenly added a bogus check at
    some point that prevented them from functioning.

    Remove checks for module owner
    
    This breaks drivers if they are compiled in the kernel.
    This doesn't affect this CVS repostry as drivers in it
    are always compiled into modules.
    However it  would affect a kernel tree exported from this repostry

    Add support for newer ENE0100 devices (KB3926C, KB3926D)
    
    Support for learning mode, and for devices that use
    unused fan feedback input as IR input is untested
    
    Groundwork for transmitting is there, but it isn't yet
    implemented, and untested.
    
    Learning mode should be enabled using some sort of ioctl,
    currently only enabled if module param 'enable_learning' is set
    
    Thanks for Giuseppe Bilotta <giuseppe.bilotta@gmail.com>

    who want to use a universal remote trained from their iMON remote.

    lirc_imon: add support for setting/enabling iMON internal clock via sysfs
    
    lcdproc can be used to set the clock on an iMON device, but it can now
    also be done by simply directing 'date' output into a sysfs attr.
    
    To show a clock on your iMON device do the following:
        # date "+%y %m %d %w %H %M %S" > /sys/.../imon_clock
    
    Requires that the display is of course present on your device, and that
    it isn't currently open (by something like lcdproc's LCDd).
    
    Tested successfully on a 15c2:ffdc VFD and 15c2:0045 LCD.
    
    Patch primarily by Vitaly V. Bursov, I just added the bits to make it
    work for the LCD devices too.

    lirc_imon: minor clarification to functionality of nomouse param
    
    What we're really doing is disabling the mouse/keyboard toggle button,
    so that when an IR client is attached, we're always in keyboard mode,
    but if no IR client is attached, the mouse device is still enabled.

    lirc_imon: add support to disable mouse mode via a modparam
    
    In certain use cases, mouse mode isn't really helpful, and could
    actually cause confusion, so allow disabling the toggle button.
    
    Most notably, mouse mode doesn't make sense for mythtv users, since
    mythtv hides the cursor by default and most of its UI doesn't accept
    mouse click input.

    lirc_imon: support setting IR protocol for either iMON or MCE/RC6 remotes
    
    Devices that do onboard decoding can be told to listen for either the iMON
    remote(s) or Windows Media Center Edition remotes (which use the RC-6 proto).
    
    Note that this addition further simplifies some setup code, as all
    devices now have a reason to need a tx urb, so we just wire it up
    unconditionally. Proto can either be specified at module load time, or
    changed on the fly by poking /sys/modules/lirc_imon/parameters/ir_protocol,
    then closing and re-opening the IR device (connecting a new IR client).

    lirc_imon: support mouse and touch input devices even when IR isn't open
    
    If we simply move urb setup and teardown into imon_probe() and
    imon_disconnect(), we can use the mouse and touch input devices
    without having to have an IR client listening. Also fixes up the
    suspend/resume routines so they should work better.
    
    Based heavily on patch by Rene Harder that followed our discussion
    on the lirc list about doing this.

    lirc_imon: touchscreen handling fixups
    
    Based on feedback and initial patch from Rene Harder, fix up
    the touchscreen handling a bit.
    
    1) Down-sampling of the touch matrix for the smaller touchscreen wasn't
    kicking in, though we never got to that point anyway...
    
    2) We never stuck around long enough to send touch data to lirc (we were
    bailing after sending it via input subsys only, we want both options).
    
    3) Within touch handler, NULL check was incorrect (s/mouse/touch/).
    
    4) Check for touch presses before mouse input, with a check for len,
    so we can filter between the two better, lest some presses get
    crossed up.
    
    5) for newer devices (ones that could potentially have a touch screen),
    improve filtering of touchscreen vs. d-pad mouse input (mouse input
    always has len == 5).

    lirc_imon: make mouse support actually work in the older devices
    
    The older gen imon devices decode mouse buttons and pad presses
    completely differently than newer devices. Getting messy, but I
    think this should do it... Pad is behaving on an ffdc imon knob,
    will get mouse buttons tested tomorrow (working with an ffdc
    device about 200 miles away from me at my brother's place. :)

    lirc_imon: add mouse and touchscreen input device support
    
    Add an input device for the iMON PAD remote in mouse mode, and
    on supported devices, a touchscreen input device. Also based
    heavily on Rene Harder's iMON Touch patch submitted to the lirc
    mailing list back in Nov. '08, but adapted to benefit all the
    recent iMON devices.
    
    Nb: does NOT yet work with the older ffdc devices, but it
    shouldn't be terribly difficult to add support once I find
    a guinea pig...

    lirc_imon: support dual-interface device with a single lirc device
    
    Recent iMON devices have dual usb interfaces, and up until now, lirc
    configures them as two separate lirc devices, which must then be
    bound together in userspace to function properly. Its pretty much
    the opposite of user-friendly. These changes are based in no small
    part on a patch submitted to the lirc mailing list back in Nov. '08
    by Rene Harder, but benefit all recent iMON devices, instead of just
    the Touch devices.
    
    Tested reasonably rigorously with the Antec-branded 0045 device I've
    got here.

    identified yet, but we know they exist or are in the works, based on a
    look at 'strings Setup/data1.hdr |grep 15c2' in the Windows driver zip.

    lirc_imon: add more device support, fix up recent additions
    
    -add support for Antec-branded iMon devices:
     * 15c2:0044 VFD (tested by a user on the mailing list)

     * 15c2:0042 and 0043 guessed device IDs for two IR-only devices
    -add support for iMon MINI (15c2:0041)
    -fix up 0036, its actually a VFD, not LCD
    -revive larger 8 byte buffer for 15c2:0038 and new 15c2:0045 device so all
     buttons on remote and panel work (config file for 0045 forthcoming)
    -rename vfd_* functions that apply to vfd and lcd to display_*
    -bump version

    lirc_imon: further improvements to lcd device support
    
    - auto-detect and auto-configure lcd devices, instead of keying on hard-coded
      is_lcd device parameter
    - replace is_lcd with display_type, which can be used to override auto-detection
    - collapse lcd device list and large buffer list into one, so far as I've been
      able to tell so far, the two are synonymous
    - add ir-only device list, don't set up a display on these devices
    - fix inverted lcd setup packet bytes

    Apparently, some remotes emit both 4 and 5 byte codes.  This change accepts codes >= 4.  we can assume that the code will be <= maxp <= BUF_LEN.  I'm not sure how LIRC/LIRC_DEV will handle bytes_in_key = 4 with a 5 byte input...
    
    One user reports:
    The remote which is described in German including a picture under
    http://www.pearl.de/product.jsp?pdid=PE4444&catid=5005&rate=5
    has some mouse movement keys. These and the corresponding mouse buttons have
    4-byte codes (7 codes). The rest  which are more than 30 keys have 5-byte
    codes.

    appears to fix inc/dec problem - we shouldn't disconnect the remote on dec, but wait until the remote receiver is unplugged or the module is unloaded.  On inc, we should connect the remote only if it hasn't been already connected (the original problem).

    - lirc_dev:
    	- Introduces 'struct lirc_buffer' and functions to handle it.
    		- Moves the lock and wait queue to 'struct lirc_buffer'.
    		- Locking happens implicitly on lirc_buffer_[read!write]_1.
    		- The caller is responsible of locking on
    		  _lirc_buffer_[read!write]_1
    	- Plugins can provide an 'struct lirc_buffer' for reading.
    	- Remove 'struct irctl'->bytes_in_key in favor of 'struct
    	  lirc_buffer'->chunk_size.
    	- Extends lirc_dev's irctl_read and irctl_poll to acomodate lirc_serial.
    
    - lirc_serial:
    	- Integrates lirc_serial with the above, removing lirc_poll and
    	  lirc_read.

    - Make set_use_inc return an int to allow the plugins to reject an open.
    - Move features into 'struct lirc_plugin' to allow the plugins to specify it's
      features.
    - Add an 'ioctl' function pointer to 'struct lirc_plugin' so plugins have a
      chance to handle ioctl's before the general cases are handled.
    - Extend the lirc_dev's ioctl handling to be more generic so it meets
      lirc_serial's needs.
    - Make lirc_serial take advantage of lirc_dev's new capabilities.
    - Make all other drivers fit with lirc_dev's changes.

    - Renamed calc_pulse_lengths_in_clocks into init_timing_params and wrote one
      for the !USE_RDTSC case.
    - Inlined 'void on(void)' and 'void off(void)', better performance, and timing
      will not depend on CPU that much.
    - Broke up send_pulse_homebrew, it now calls send_pulse_homebrew_softcarrier.
      And the implementation of send_pulse_homebrew_softcarrier depends on
      USE_RDTSC.
