  * new upstream version 0.9.0~pre1:
    - rediff patches against 0.8.6:
      + drop 20_kcompat-2.6.26.patch, applied upstream.
      + drop 21_silence-LIRC_MODE_LIRCCODE-logmessage.patch, it's no longer
        necessary due to udev & hal acting upon hotplug events.
      + drop 22_kcompat-2.6.27.patch, applied upstream.
      + drop 23_man_pages_style_fixes.patch, mostly applied upstream.
      + drop 24_kcompat-2.6.29.patch, applied upstream.
      + drop 25_kcompat-2.6.31.patch, applied upstream.
    - fixed by the new upstream version:
      + lirc: Please update to version 0.8.4a (Closes: #517507).
      + lirc: The version upstream is now at 0.8.6. Please upgrade this
        package as it's a show stopper for me (Closes: #548826).
      + lirc-modules-source: lirc_imon doesnt find hardware (Closes: #500714).
      + lirc: Please add support for blaster of Hauppauge PVR150
        (Closes: 505049).

      + drop kcompat-2.6.33.patch, merged upstream
      + drop kcompat-2.6.35.patch, merged upstream

      + drop 99_linux-input-layer_config, it should be obsolete now.
      + drop lirc-in-kernel-ioctls, merged upstream.
      + drop 18_pinsys-keycodes.
      + update fix-kfreebsd-ftbs.patch to fix newly introduced __u32/ __u64
        breakage on kFreeBSD; extend this change to all non-linux
        architectures, given that it fails on hurd as well. Use stdint.h and
        ISO C99 uint32_t/ uint64_t.
      + drop 11_cheklib_fix.patch; while it is technically correct, it doesn't
        actually have a real effect and is not upstreamable.
      + drop 90_make-module-defines-unique.patch and warning-cleanup.patch,
        lirc-modules-source doesn't get built anymore.
      + avoid patching generated Makefiles by ensuring identical dates to avoid
        autofoo/ libtool; this allows dropping 02_Makefiles.patch.
      + drop 12_enodev_on_read.patch, it doesn't appear to be required anymore.
  * suggest setserial (Closes: #546247).
  * drop the udevadm settle call from the init script, it can lead to a
    deadlock in combination with hotpluggable/ udev aware devices.
  * fix conditional branches for 22_kcompat-2.6.27.patch (Closes: #547359).
  * switch to Debian source format 3.0 (quilt).
  * adapt watch file for bzip2 tarballs.
  * drop debian/TODO, most entries are obsolete.
  * create /var/run/lirc/ as needed.
  * use --oknodo for start-stop-daemon.
  * lirc 0.8.6 moves the lircd socket from /dev/ to /var/run/lirc/, create a
    symlink to retain compatibility with old clients.

    [ Mario Limonciello ]
    - debian/control: add build-depends on libftdi-dev to prevent FTBFS.
    - [PATCH 8/8] Add udev support to lirc and init script
    - remove build time debug messages for kernel drivers
  * add compatibility for kernel 2.6.32 (Closes: #562512, #588027).
  * add compatibility for kernel 2.6.33/ 2.6.34.
  * add maintainerclean target to debian/rules, to ease dealing with the
    current way of maintaining the lirc package with svn-buildpackage's
    mergeWithUpstream mode.
  * document the kernel/ userspace ABI breakage between lirc 0.8.6 and earlier
    versions in NEWS.
  * debian/rules: fix stanza dependencies for parallel building (FTBS on
    buildds with activated build concurrency).
  * fix lintian complaint about "lirc: conflicts-with-version makedev
    (<< 2.3.1-88)", a recent enough makedev (or none at all, if using udev) is
    only required by postinst, not at unpack time.
  * debian/NEWS: fix cosmetic formatting issues as pointed out by lintian:
    - lirc: debian-news-entry-uses-asterisk
    - lirc: debian-news-entry-without-blank-line line 13
  * add compatibility for kernel 2.6.35.
  * bump compat level to 8, supported by debhelper >=7.9.3 in squeeze.
    - replace dh_clean -k by dh_prep.
  * drop silent clobbering of the lirc configuration with misplaced files.
  * make syntax check for hardware.conf more robust.
  * drop obsolete lirc-svga package, its functionality is also provided by
    lirc-x and has only been built for x86.
  * drop and conflict with (using breaks) lirc-modules-source, starting with
    kernel 2.6.36 lirc has been merged mainline and this package targets
    post-squeeze anyways - this indirectly fixes:
    - Failed to attach i2c client PV951 IR at 0x4b (-17) (Closes: #500429)
    - lirc 0.8.3-5 breaks mceusb2 remote (Closes: #551706), replaced by new
      in-kernel RC_CORE module "mceusb".
    - lirc_sir: device fails to resume after suspend (Closes: #414014)
    - sysfs: duplicate filename '0-0018' can not be created (Closes: #496681)
  * rename patches for upstream submission:
    - 04_man_pages_syntax_fixes.patch --> man-pages_syntax-fixes.patch
    - 05_non_linux.patch --> lirc_fix-build-on-non-Linux-architectures.patch
    - 22_fix-spelling-errors.patch --> lirc_fix-spelling-errors.patch
    - 13_hurd_define_iotbase_u32.patch --> hurd_define-iotbase_u32.patch
  * external ABI between kernel modules broke between 0.8.3 --> 0.8.4 and
    0.8.7 --> 0.9.0, break lirc-modules-source (<<0.9.0~).
  * drop obsolete debconf configuration:
    - lirc should use debconf more fully (Closes: #162933)
    - [INTL:nl] Updated Dutch po-debconf translation (Closes: #605610).
    - [INTL:da] Danish translation of the debconf templates (Closes: #607575)
  * drop pre-woody compatibility.
  * don't try to install the upstream "ChangeLog", it's empty since upstream
    moved to git.
  * don't symlink /usr/share/doc/<package>/ anymore.
  * declare a build-conflicts with libsvga1-dev.
  * suggest "ir-keytable", it is required to configure scancodes for in-kernel
    modules using the new RC_CORE subsystem.
  * bump standards version to 3.9.1, now that the major roadblocks are finally
    fixed.
  * document that lirc uses syslog for all logging functionality since 0.6.5-1,
    (Closes: #580666).
  * use current maintainer script syntax.
  * drop pre-squeeze versioned depends.

    - [PATCH 2/8] Cleanup whitespace in lirc.postinst
    - [PATCH 7/8] Source lsb init functions in init script
      - apply this patch first, we can't use any LSB function without
        sourcing it first.
      - depend on lsb-base.
    - [PATCH 3/8] Update load_modules to use LSB functions
      - keep the udevadm settle call, we need it for now.
      - local var=foo is neither allowed by SUSv3, nor by Debian's special

      - continue to use tab to indent.

      - local var=foo is neither allowed by SUSv3, nor by Debian's special
        excemptions; fix this bashism/ dashism.

  * employ standard line wrapping in debian/control stanzas.
  * refer to GPL-2 explicitly in debian/copyright.
  * make lintian happy and don't call ucf with its full path (policy 6.1).
  * install upstream changelog also into arch-indep packages.
  * severity medium, as this fixes lirc-modules-source FTBS against
    kernel >= 2.6.27.

    (Closes: #491772).
  * add italian debconf translation, thanks to Vincenzo Campanella
    <vinz65@gmail.com>.
  * silence LIRC_MODE_LIRCCODE log message, as it is not rate limited and
    tends to overflow syslog in case IR receivers get removed without
    stopping lirc or removing the configuration; this is a temporary
    band-aid for lenny and no long term solution (Closes: #500421).

 -- Stefan Lippers-Hollmann <s.l-h@gmx.de>  Tue, 30 Sep 2008 01:28:27 +0200

lirc (0.8.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * remove dead code (modutils has only been used for kernel 2.4 and the
    affected code blocks weren't reachable since 0.8.3-1 anyways, as the
    conffile wasn't shipped in the first place).
  * conflict with makedev << 2.3.1-88, lirc either needs a fixed version or
    none at all (Closes: #477063).
  * 0.8.3-1 hasn't transitioned to testing yet, so keep the urgency at medium
    as it fixes several serious bugs (oops in lirc_i2c on kernel 2.6.25, FTBS
    against 2.6.26, missing module versions rejected by kernel >= 2.6.26,
    custom mknod replaced by proper makedev calls, if installed).

lirc (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * new upstream release 0.8.3 (Closes: #481649).
  * rediff patches:
    - 02_Makefile.in
    - 04_man_pages
    - 05_non_linux
    - 06_libtool_kfreebsd
  * drop patches merged upstream:
    - 16_kcompat-2.6.23
    - 17_kcompat-2.6.24
    - 20_kcompat-2.6.25
    - 19_enable-macmini-as-userspace-driver
  * remove local scope definition for variables in lirc.init.d following
    SUSv3, its current use for MODULES_MISSING and ARGS doesn't justify
    making use of the exceptions specified in Debian policy 10.4
    (Closes: #471422).
  * fix copy and paste error in lirc-modules-source.README.Debian.
  * lirc_i2c: fix kernel oops on 2.6.25, patch taken from upstream CVS.
  * change debconf defaults for lirc-modules-source:
    - drop lirc_gpio, it is affected by API changes in bttv and FTBS since
      2.6.23.
    - enable atiusb.
    - enable bt829.
    - enable cmdir.
    - enable igorplugusb.
    - enable imon.
    - enable it87.
    - enable mceusb/ mceusb2.
    - keep lirc_parallel disabled, it is not SMP safe.
    - enable sasem.
    - enable streamzap.
    - enable sir, keep the defaults at generic sir controller (other) port
      0x2f8 and irq 3, which seems to be supported by a short poll among
      notebook owners.
    - enable serial, keep defaulting to generic (home-brewed) IR receivers,
      change to ttyS0 (port 0x3f8, irq 4) as most concurrently sold systems
      only ship one serial port.
  * replace custom mknod usage by using makdev's newly added lirc support and
    add a versioned dependency on a fixed makedev version instead. This
    dependency can be relaxed to udev | makedev, once makedev (>= 2.3.1-88)
    has been shipped in a stable release. Given that Breaks support isn't
    usable until lenny+1, this conservative approach is the safer variant for
    etch --> lenny upgrades (Closes: #393575, #477063).
  * drop debian/lirc.config.in, which was added as a bandaid for #329897
    alltogether, neither it nor setup-driver.sh are used anywhere on the end
    user's system; this allows dropping the pre-dependency on dialog and
    lirc.config.md5sum as well.
  * add a sanity check to debian/rules' clean target to ensure that
    liblirclient0's pkg-config file is up to date.
  * add compatibility code for udev >= 0.117, avoid flag day changes or a hard
    dependency on udev; inspired by Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>
    (Closes: #456325).
  * restructure lirc-modules-source package to dump all module sources
    directly into the toplevel directory (omit upstream's Makefiles from
    module subdirectories) and replace custom toplevel Makefile with a simple
    in-kernel style buildsystem. This fixes symbol versioning for the kernel
    modules and, as a side effect, the clean target of the top-level Makefile
    and doesn't allow empty port/ IRQ settings.
    (Closes: #450521, #483089, #369076)
  * add compatibility patch for kernels >= 2.6.26, based on upstream CVS.
  * drop debian/lirc.modules, modutils is obsolete (kernel 2.4).
  * make lirc-modules-source compatible with linux-modules-extra-2.6:
    - use bzip2 to compress the source tarball.
    - change path names to correspond with the package name.
  * fix LIRC_IRQ redefinition.

    neither etch nor lenny are affected.
  * add LSB header to lirc initscript as suggested by Petter Reinholdtsen
    <pere@hungry.com> (Closes: #460212).
  * add LSB Description and Short-Description to initscript LSB stanza,
    borrowed from Ubuntu's lirc packages by Mario Limonciello

  * apply patch from Václav Ovsík <vaclav.ovsik@i.cz> to fix Makefile
    mangling for lirc-source, evaluating utsrelease.h instead of the no longer
    existing version.h and recommend linux-image-$KVERS instead of the
    obsolete kernel-image-$KVERS (Closes: #447172).
  * drop no longer existing dpatch suffix from patch series and refresh

    (Closes: #399135, #434569, #457858, #463388, #464777).
  * fix lirc.conf template for pinsys remotes, shortly before lirc 0.8.2 the
    keymapping got broken.
  * remove versioned download location from debian/copyright, it's always
    outdated and the base path will point to the download location just as
    well.
  * apply useful indention from Ubuntu to debian/rules.
  * Recommend module-assistant | kernel-package for lirc-modules-source.
  * add watch file pointing to lirc.org, not sourceforge.
  * restore author information and short descriptions for debian/patches/*.
  * add Basque translation "eu", thanks to Christian Perrier
    <bubulle@debian.org> and Piarres Beobide <pi@beobide.net>
    (Closes: #470363).
  * fix debian/copyright to refer to "GPL v2 or later", not a single source
    file seems to be licensed under the GPL v1.
  * rewrite debian/modules-source/debian/rules from scratch and rely on common
    kernel module handling based in module-assistant, this allows bumping the
    standards version to 3.7.3 (Closes: #372815, #440514).
  * add Homepage, Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser tags.
  * modules-source/README.make is obsolete, as it only talks about kernel 2.2
    and 2.4 specifics, while kernel 2.6 is covered by the other READMEs.
  * drop bogus Recommends from lirc-modules-source, build-essentials are an
    implicit requirement by definition.
  * drop no longer valid statements from the module READMEs.
  * no longer try to install etc/modutils/*, lenny will not support kernel
    2.4.
  * bump compat level to 5, which is supported by etch (backports), but lets
    dh_install error out if wildcards expand to nothing.
  * drop 03_extra_files, shipping private copies of bttv headers for random
    kernels doesn't work.
  * run debconf-updatepo, confirm that no strings get lost.
  * remove informal_module_building(), while it may look convenient to the
    user, the results were unpackaged modules of questionable quality that
    cannot be removed on purge. module-assistant or make-kpkg are the
    preferred way of module building (Closes: #404505).
  * Update and partly rewrite the module source documentation to the new
    packaging and explicitly mention the full source requirement for gio
    (Closes: #429249).
  * add patch based on upstream CVS to include the macmini driver in the
    hw_list used for calculating the userspace daemon config options
    (Closes: #448637).
  * set doc-base section to "Help", which seems to be suited best for a
    collection of pointers about how to work with the LIRC package.

lirc (0.6.4-10) unstable; urgency=high

  * The urgency is because:
        + 0.6.4-9: may be uninstalable.
        + reduces user frustration on module building by giving a verbose
          error message.
        + Complies with policy by not restoring deleted conffiles on the users
          back.
        + Secures device permisions.
        + There is no new feature.
  * /etc/lirc/lircmd.conf may not be there (closes: Bug#126279).
  * Don't create /etc/lirc/* files unless they are there, they should be moved
    from /etc/ or the user chooses to reconfigure the package.
  * Add MODULE_LICENSE to kernel modules, patch by Ingo Saitz <ingo@debian.org>
    This was already fixed upstream, but oh well, lets not wait to the next
    release. (closes: Bug#128074)
  * Cry out if IRQ, PORT or TIMER are not set when compiling kernel modules.
    (closes: Bug#108131)
  * Tell devfsd to create /dev/lirc/0 unconditionaly. (works around: #128072)
    The proper fix should come soon from upstream.
  * Changed permisions of kernel devices from "root.video 660" to
    "root.root 660" since only lircd should use them and it runs as root.
        By writting to this devices you may confuse kernel code and that kind
        of thing should be reserved to root. If someone feels that read-only
        access should be allowed to to other users or groups go ahead and file
        a bug.
